      - **any** - (*28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **gpu** - (*28 cores*) Use an Owens node that has an [NVIDIA Tesla P100
        GPU](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-p100.html) and loads the
        [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) 8.0.44 module. There are
        160 of these nodes on Owens.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Owens node that has 1.5TB of
        available RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on
        Owens.
    options:
      - [ "any",     ":ppn=28"         ]
